## What is Experience Engineering?

OK, so I know I just said that it's not made up. Well, to be honest it's a term that I've kinda made up (mostly), because until recently there hasn't been a good way to describe what it is that I specialize in. 

### More than just the UI

It's easy to default to "_oh you mean UI, right?_" when talking about engineering experiences.

The reality is that however that the term 'UI' means so **very much more**. UI goes _way beyond_ browser based applications.

The term 'UI', could in fact be a reference to one of the following: 

- [Graphical User Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) _(GUI)_
- [Command Line Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) _(CLI)_
- [Application Programming Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) _(API)_
- [Conversational UI](https://chatbotsmagazine.com/what-is-a-conversational-ui-and-why-it-matters-de358507b9a2)[^1] 

Let's take a look at examples of the first three of these.[^1]

    {{< image-grid-item "*json*" "JSON Payload (API)" "Image of a JSON payload used in APIS" >}}

Creating compelling experiences around these interfaces requires mastering a wide set of skills. To master these skills, one must first **master the art of interfaces**.

### The art of interfaces.

An interface is the only way we _(as humans)_ can interact with software. We do this via a graphical interface (incl. AR/VR & Gesture), or by a command/text driven interface (this also includes menu driven interfaces). We execute these these graphical, textual or conversational driven commands via physical input (_pressing physical buttons, moving a mouse or speaking_). 

Understanding [Human Computer Interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction) _(HCI)_ is a key skill to understanding the **art** of interfaces. 

It's an art, because humans engage in dialogue that is often unpredictable, open-ended and flexible. There is no fixed set of hard rules on having a conversation, we expect the same from computers. We want them to understand us, rather than the other way around.

> At the end of the day, Experience Engineering is the **_facilitator_** of great UX (User Experience) or DX (Developer Experience).

Have you have ever used a UI, API or A CLI and thought to yourself "**that was easy, I _enjoyed_ that**"?

### So what is User Experience (UX)?

Over the years, the question of **_"What is the difference between UI and UX?_** has popped up more than once. It's actually more mis-understood than you would think, so here is how I define what both mean.

**UX (User Experience)**:
: _This is what we want a consumer to -**_feel_**- as a **result** of engaging with a product_.

**UI (User Interface)**:
: _This is what **facilitates** the -**_feeling_**- you want the consumer to experience, allowing engagement with a product_.

Actually, let's use a visual aid to help explain this...

Imagine what your new application would be like to use, or consume. How would someone install it? What about the first run? What is the 
journey through the application workflow? What would the API look like? The CLI? How would they upgrade it? What about the documentation? 

Before writing a line of code, it's critical to map out **outcomes** and the best **experience** that would facilitate it. 

Only then can you move onto thinking about technology.

this is obviously a draft, please ignore all this.
