## What is Experience Engineering?

OK, so I know I just said that it's not made up. Well, to be honest it's a term that I've kinda made up (mostly), because until recently there hasn't been a good way to describe what it is that I specialize in. 

### More than just the UI

It's easy to default to "_oh you mean UI, right?_" when talking about engineering experiences.

The reality is that however that the term 'UI' means so **very much more**. UI goes _way beyond_ browser based applications.

The term 'UI', could in fact be a reference to one of the following: 

- **_Graphical User Interface_** (GUI)
- **_Command Line Interface_** (CLI)
- **_Application Programming Interface_** (API)

Let's take a look at examples of each of these.

    {{< image-grid-item "*json*" "JSON Payload (API)" "Image of a JSON payload used in APIS" >}}

Creating compelling experiences around these interfaces requires mastering a wide set of skills. To master these skills, one must first **master the art of interfaces**.

Have you have ever used a UI, API or A CLI and thought to yourself "**that was easy, I _enjoyed_ that**"?

Imagine what your new application would be like to use, or consume. How would someone install it? What about the first run? What is the 
journey through the application workflow? What would the API look like? The CLI? How would they upgrade it? What about the documentation? 

Before writing a line of code, it's critical to map out **outcomes** and the best **experience** that would facilitate it. 

Only then can you move onto thinking about technology.
