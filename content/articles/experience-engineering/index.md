## What is Experience Engineering?

OK, so I know I just said that it's an actual term. It's a term that I've _kind of_ made up. It is, however, composed of real things that all revolve around designing
and building **experiences**.

### More than just User Interface.

It's easy to default to "_...oh you mean UI, right?_" when talking about engineering experiences.

The reality, however, is the term 'UI' means **more** than a browser-based application. UI goes _way beyond_ that. 'UI' could be a reference to one of the following: 

- [Graphical User Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) _(GUI)_
- [Command Line Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) _(CLI)_
- [Application Programming Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) _(API)_
- [Conversational UI](https://chatbotsmagazine.com/what-is-a-conversational-ui-and-why-it-matters-de358507b9a2)[^1] 

Here are examples of the first three of these.[^1]

    {{< image-grid-item "*cli*" "CLI (Command Line Interface)" "Image of a CLI" >}}
    {{< image-grid-item "*json*" "JSON Payload (API)" "Image of a JSON payload used in APIS" >}}
{{< /image-grid >}}

### The art of interfaces.

An interface is the only way we _(as humans)_ can interact with software. 

We do this via graphical interfaces (incl. AR/VR & Gesture) or by command/text-driven interfaces (including menu-driven interfaces). We execute visual, textual, or conversational driven commands via physical input in some form of _pressing or moving physical buttons/controls, brain waves, eye-tracking, or speech_. 

Understanding [Human Computer Interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction) _(HCI)_ is key to fluidity in the **art** of interfaces. Interface design and engineering require understanding what someone **_would expect to see and how they would react_** when thinking about how to achieve a goal using a computer.

It's an art because humans engage in dialogue that is often unpredictable, open-ended, and flexible. There is no fixed set of rigid rules on having a conversation; we expect the same from computers. **_We want them to understand us_**.

Experience Engineering is the **_facilitator_** of great UX (User Experience) or DX (Developer Experience).

{{< default-box >}}
Have you have ever used a UI, API, SDK, or CLI and thought to yourself, "**that was easy, I _enjoyed_ that**"?
{{< /default-box >}}

### What is User Experience (UX)?

The question **_"What is the difference between UI and UX?_** has popped up more than once. It's more misunderstood than you would think; here is how I define what both mean.

**UX (User Experience)**:
: _This is what we want a consumer to -**_feel_**- as a **result** of engaging with a product_.

**UI (User Interface)**:
: _This is what **facilitates** the -**_feeling_**- we want the consumer to experience when engaging with a product_.

Let's use a visual aid to help explain this.

{{< inline-figure "*ux-vs-ui-8bit*" "User Experience (UX) vs. User Interface (UI)" "Image of a man reclining on an ugly chair using a handle to operate it" "960" "811">}}

The man loves to **_recline_** in his ugly [^2] chair. To facilitate this experience (UX), he uses a handle (UI) to pull out the footrest and shift the chair mechanism into a reclined position.

## What about Developer Experience (DX)?

DX is a **_sibling_** to UX and UI. The focus is on developers and their experience while building applications on top of (or using) a product. 

**Developers want simple tools** that **_'just work' and then get out of the way_**. They have little time for '_yet another learning curve_.' A developer wants a tool to feel familiar and intuitive, like picking up a screwdriver. 

Developer tools need to **fit** into existing workflows or existing development environments. 

{{< inline-figure "*dx-ux-ui*" "DX (Developer Experience) vs. UX vs. UI and the epicenter of Experience Engineering " "diagram showing the relationship between UX, UI, and DX." >}}

The **Experience Engineering Epicenter** is where _all sides of the spectrum_ meet and experiences converge. It's the **_most exciting space for creative engineers I can think of_**. The challenges are complex, and the problem space is enormous.

In her excellent article [The Case for Developer Experience](https://future.a16z.com/the-case-for-developer-experience/), Jean Yang states:

> "No matter what, developer experience for such tools is going to be **_the_** thing. Having good complexity-exploring tools is going to be a crucial competitive advantage â€” and having good developer experience for exploring complexity will be a key advantage for developer tools. These tools will may change how software gets made"

In my [opinion]({{< ref "disclaimer">}}), **Good DX** can make a **_million_** dollar company, a **billion** dollar one.

## Experience Engineering, Industrial Design for Interfaces.

> "_[Industrial design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_design) is a process of design applied to physical products that are to be manufactured by mass production. 
It is the **_creative act_** of determining and defining a **_product's form and features_**_"

To any software user, **the interface is what takes the form of the product**. 

If an application's features are clever, but the interfaces are clunky, inconsistent, and hard to consume - that product won't have any consumers.[^3]

An application developer experiences a product **through an API or SDK**. A DevSecOps or Automation Engineer does the same **through an API or CLI**. An end-user of a product will most likely experience it **through a UI**.[^4]

However **_all three types_**  can _mix-and-match_ experiences at any time. **Consistency** across all interfaces is essential. No one wants to learn one set of behaviors and terms, only to have a completely different set thrown at them when shifting from API to CLI consumption.

Early-stage / innovative users of a product will put up with clunky, inconsistent, and half-baked interfaces. Mainstream, pragmatic consumers **will not**.

## Experience is a differentiator when Crossing the Chasm.

The excellent hit tech marketing bible [Crossing The Chasm](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062292986/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0062292986&linkCode=as2&tag=quobix-20&linkId=4380940d531d2edf7a9a0874ed8ed364) by Geoffrey A. Moore talks about the _chasm_ that exists when taking a product from the '_early adopter_' phase to the **_'early majority'_**, during the **technology adoption lifecycle:**:

{{< inline-figure "*chasm*" "The chasm is the most dangerous place to be (if you're a technology product)" "illustration of the chasm, part of the technology life cycle" >}}

The chasm exists because a product or interface experience cannot move past the eager early adopters willing to put up with glitches and hacks. 

The early majority are **pragmatists** and will be looking for a _polished, consistent, reliable, and functional_ experience.

Have you have ever gone looking for a feature without knowing where it would be and '**_just found it_**'?

### Consistency, Accessibility, Simplicity, Convenience, and Self-Service

By focusing on these five principles when building a modern SaaS-based application or service, a new product's chances of crossing the chasm **improve significantly**. 

The early majority will not accept a clunky and complex out-of-the-box experience; they won't tolerate things like a half-cooked API that is not backward compatible. 

> If a product is composed of closed source SDKs, single platform CLIs, slow and _desktop only_ (non-responsive) GUIs, weak or non-mobile experiences, crappy docs, or non-functional sample code 
> chances are it's going to **_sink into that chasm_**, like so many before it.

**Consistency**
: **_A GUI, CLI, SDK, and API should all work alongside each other_**. All are using the same vocabulary and design patterns across every touchpoint.

**Accessibility**
: **_[a11y](https://www.a11yproject.com/) is not something you think about at the end_**. It has to be part of the fabric of every architecture. Baked into the very core from the start.

**Simplicity**
: **_Don't make consumers think_**. Have you ever been embarrassed trying to figure out how to fold up a kid's pushchair? Interfaces should feel intrinsic and intuitive. Cognitive load is a bad thing in this case.

**Convenience**
: **_Make it easy to join, install, upgrade and operate from (and on) any device_**. A SaaS product needs to be consumable from a smart fridge or a microcontroller. 

**Self-Service**
: **_Banks < ATMs < Apple Pay_**. Always aim to deliver super-fast time to value without a barrier to entry. People will consume more if they can self-serve on-demand.

{{< card "Thinking backward is the way forward." >}}
Experience **should always come first** in any new software product or technology development idea. Before writing a single line of code, it should be possible to roughly articulate the end-to-end experiences of a minimum viable product (MVP). 

These experiences need to consider multiple personas, like _admins, operators, end-users, developers, automation_, etc.

Architecting software from an experience first perspective **opens up many more technology paths for potential solutions**. Starting with technology first is **_always going to limit_** interface options and **_reduce_** the number of experiences possible.

Bottom-up (engineering first) often results in interfaces being shoe-horned in, or '**_slapped_**' on at the end. Resulting in long, complex wizards, 
or a sea of buttons, dials and options, steps, and a broken application state.

The end-to-end experience for a consumer is what **matters**. _Not_ how clever the tech is underneath.

Amazon uses this technique with new product development via the [PR FAQ strategy](https://www.quora.com/What-is-Amazons-approach-to-product-development-and-product-management).
