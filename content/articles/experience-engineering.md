## What is Experience Engineering?

OK, so I know I just said that it's not made up. Well, to be honest it's a term that I've made up myself mostly, because until recently there hasn't been a good way to describe what I do.

Have you have ever used a UI, API or A CLI and thought to yourself "**that was easy, I _enjoyed_ that**"?

Imagine what your new application would be like to use, or consume. How would someone install it? What about the first run? What is the 
journey through the application workflow? What would the API look like? The CLI? How would they upgrade it? What about the documentation? 

Before writing a line of code, it's critical to map out **outcomes** and the best **experience** that would facilitate it. 

Only then can you move onto thinking about technology.
