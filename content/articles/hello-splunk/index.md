## A distinguished engineer

Today I started a brand new role at [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com). I've joined as **Distinguished Engineer** in the **_Security_** group as UI Architect of SaaS Applications.

In 1997 I founded **hack-net.com** (don't visit the site). It was one of the most significant security-related websites on the internet for a while. We used to get millions of visitors a week and had 20+ contributors on the platform.

## What happened to it?

Music, Girls, and Alcohol got in the way. Like a fool, I closed it down in 2002.

## Security was my original jam

{{< warn-box >}}
Time to get back into the groove. It's been **_two decades_** since I last played in that arena.

I can't wait to start some fires. I am now a **_Splunker_**, **Wish me luck**.
