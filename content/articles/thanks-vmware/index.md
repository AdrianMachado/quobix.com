This is my story about the most incredible time I had at VMware. I want to tell you about the most valuable experience I had; it's the one thing that I can **never** thank VMware _enough_ for.

## A bumpy arrival

In early 2012, I was the CTO of a failing start-up that I co-founded. Money had dried up; I had to let go of everything.

I had recently emigrated to the USA from the UK, and my (ex) wife was divorcing me because she had fallen in love with another man she had met while I was trying to build a business.

**Flat-broke**, **burned out**, **heartbroken**, **abandoned**, and generally feeling quite sorry for myself.

I needed something **_completely new_** in my life; I needed a **new career**. 

---

## A search for hope

I saw a job posting that I thought I would be good at on the [VMware careers website](https://careers.vmware.com/main/), and I applied. VMware was a brand I knew well, and I used consumer products as a developer for a while.

_Weeks and weeks_ went by without hearing anything. Having built recruitment and candidate management systems before, I just knew my application had gone into a **black hole**. 

Giving up hope, I started looking elsewhere, and then one afternoon, I got an email from a VMware recruiter. It was about a completely different role, but after a couple of interviews with some duff companies - **it was most uplifting**.

---

My interview experience was great; I was grilled by eight people over eight hours on the phone.

I got a coding test from (who is now) one of VMware's most respected Principal Engineers, and then I was flown to Palo Alto for a whole day of interviews. 

I wore **cowboy boots** and tried to style my facial hair like **_Wolverine_**. I wanted people to at least _remember me_.

I was offered a **Staff Engineer** position a few days later.  

My Journey at VMware was about to begin, and my mutton chops must have been the key to landing the gig.

---

## Dave, meet Dave.

I was **_flat_** broke. VMware told me to fly to Cambridge, MA, for my first day to meet my new (remote) team. 

I **had to borrow** the money for the flight and the hotel; I didn't want VMware to know I was on my knees.

--- 

On my first day, I was introduced to a _giant_ man named **Dave Gress**.

A Senior Staff Engineer and old-school assembly and C hacker, I watched this man debug software by literally **_watching the processor_**. I had never seen such a skill. 

That evening, Dave invited me for a whiskey. We talked long into the night and enjoyed multiple rounds of liquid fire. I was not used to spending company money; it was a real treat. 

I **_really_** liked Dave; he **understood** me.

---

## The beginning of my life. 

Dave has a daughter. Her name is **Michelle**, and she also worked at VMware. 

{{< warn-box >}}
Legend has it that she was one of only a few people that knew how to get [Autodeploy on ESXi](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.esxi.install.doc/GUID-DC5D6EA2-2F17-4CB0-A0DB-C767F2BE2FBA.html) to work correctly.
{{< /warn-box >}}

My first introduction to her was when Dave told me to message her on Skype and ask her about something to do with a '**_Mechanical Bull at a bar in Palo Alto_**'.

Michelle promptly responded: 

> "Who are you? do I know you?" 

And then she **blocked me**.

---

## Welcome to the gang.

Dave and the team were **_laughing_** their asses off at me. 

As the new guy, **I had been pranked!** And most likely (_unknowingly_) committed some kind of HR violation on my **first-day**, no less.

A few weeks later, I was in Palo Alto, and we had gathered for an on-site all-hands with my new team.

One lunchtime, I was preparing to leave the conference room we were sitting in, and then I saw Michelle for the first time as she walked past me. 

She **_smiled_** at me.

---

## Wow, that girl, that's the girl!

My eyes **lit up**, and my **_heart skipped a beat_**; **She was beautiful**.

Flying home, I **_could not get her out of my mind_**. I could not stop thinking about my co-worker's _hot daughter_.

{{< error-box >}}
This was going to be an issue. 
{{< /error-box >}}

{{< card "The big risky decision" >}}
I **_wanted_** to be with her, and I didn't even know her, and I just had a feeling she would understand me. She grew up with a hacker for a father, and she too worked in high-tech. She _knew the game_ and **understood the universe** I lived in.

This conclusion was assuming she would be interested in me back, so this is all me daydreaming like an arrogant and egotistical fool at this point.

Nonetheless, I was going to try and **win her heart**.
{{< /card >}}

At VMworld San Francisco 2012, I got to talk to her face to face for a few minutes. We talked about our dogs, and I had two pups, and she had a big beautiful Doberman named Magnum. 

**I was enraptured with her**.

We didn't see each other again after that for a couple of months, not until VMworld in Barcelona. 

---

## Time to make a move

After drinks on the roof-top pool and lots of all my (**_most excellent_**) lines, I asked Michelle back to my hotel room for a whiskey... **she agreed to**. 


{{< info-box >}}
I should point out here that Michelle absolutely **HATES** whiskey. I discovered this a while later.
{{< /info-box >}}

I **kissed the girl**. And she **_kissed me back_**. 


---

## The adventure begins.

We were **_convinced_** we were being discreet. However, the **entire team** had seen us _disappear_ together and _re-appear_ together the next day. This **included Dave**, her father.

I must admit, it was **_more_** than a bit awkward walking into the NOC (Network Operations Center) that morning with Dave, **he knew**, and **_I knew that he knew_**. 

Dave Gress is a **big**, solid man, 6 foot 7 inches tall. I am **_literally_** a foot shorter than him.

I nervously fumbled the words: 

> "Dave, I want to..."

He interrupted me:

> "I know."

Stunned, I stuttered: 

> "Are... Are you OK with..."

He interrupted again:

> "You two are perfect for each other."

---

A **giant grin** rose from his face, and then he gave me a friendly '**_pat_**' on the back.

However, due to the man's '[Wreck-It Ralph-esque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wreck-It_Ralph)' stature, 
it can often feel more like being hit with a tree trunk.

## That day was the moment my life began. 

VMware had given me more than I had expected and more than I could have hoped for. 

I asked Dave for his permission to marry Michelle at **RADIO** (_VMware's annual internal R&D Conference_) in 2014. 

{{< card "Another grin appeared across his face..." >}}
He said **yes**.

## Michelle and I got married in 2015. 

{{< inline-figure "*wedding*" "Michael Jackson showed up! Even though he had died nine years prior" "Image of my wife and I in our wedding attire, with a michael jackson impersonator between us" >}}

We invited all our VMware friends and colleagues to celebrate in Las Vegas with us. 

---

Our daughter **Melody** was born in 2018, 

{{< inline-figure "*melody*" "Our little song." "Image of our daughter melody staring up at the camera" >}}

---

Our son **Maddox** was born in 2021. 

{{< inline-figure "*meddy*" "Our most precious." "Image of our son maddox and our daughter melody laughing on a white blanket" >}}

---

Dave is now my **Father-in-law**. We spend holidays together, he's an **_incredible_** grandfather, and he **still** loves to **_hack code_** and **break things**.

I was alone and broken as a new immigrant to the US; VMware gave me a home and offered me a chance to build a new life.

The **most valuable** reward for my service and time at the company was **our family**.

## Time for a new beginning

{{< inline-figure "*dave-and-michelle*" "Thank you, VMware." "Image my wife and I, hugging on the beach" >}}

I **will miss you** and all the incredible people that work there. You have a **special place** in my **_soul_**.

Be seeing you around.

Dave ❤️.
