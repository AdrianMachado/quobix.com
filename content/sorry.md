Hi Friend, 

I just wanted to say, that I am **sorry** if I have offended you. 

There isn't ever a situation in which I am trying to be hurtful, or exert rudeness (I hate both of those things). 

If you have experienced emotional distress because of something I did, said or wrote, then please accept my **_genuine apology_** :hearts:.

Sometimes, I mis-read intent. Sometimes I forget how brutal even the most innocent words can be, when used in a certain context. 

Sometimes I simply _let my emotions get the better of me_ and I am **_unable to use my words properly_**.

By causing you offense, I have _failed_ in my mission to **balance** **_logic, reason and empthy_**. 

I'll keep trying to do better, please don't give up on me.

**- Dave**.
