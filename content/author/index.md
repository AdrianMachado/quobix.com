**Hi, I'm Dave Shanley.**

I'm a software architect, inventor, technical leader and failed musician.

I have about twenty five years of experience with designing and building software, across a variety of industries and businesses.

My speciality is **Experience Engineering**, which _generally means_ that I design and build technology that you **_engage with_** as a consumer.

[VMware](https://vmware.com) is where I work, as a **Sr. Staff Engineer**. I am Architect of Developer Experience (DX).

## Making complex things feel simple and intuitive.

This is my **ultimate goal**, Creating the **_big red 'easy' button_**.

The easy button means abstracting away a lot of different technology. This is pretty cool because it means I get to touch a lot of *fast moving* tech. 

I specialize in UI, CLI API and *developer experience* in general, however I've designed and built entire platforms, SaaS products, developer tools, text compilers, enterprise recruitment and content management systems, games, messaging frameworks, interactive art as well as a billion+ dollar product.
